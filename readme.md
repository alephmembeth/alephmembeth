## Hi There! 👋

My name’s Max. I’m a postdoctoral research assistant (‘Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter’) at the University of Oldenburg’s Department of Philosophy, mainly working at the intersection of philosophy and empirical social research in an area known as ‘experimental philosophy’ (or ‘x-phi’ for short). Besides that, I’m also meddling in ludology (or game studies) and digital humanities. If you want to learn more about me or my research, why not visit my [website](https://alephmembeth.github.io/)?

Want to know what’s happening in the world of x-phi right now? Visit [The Experimental Philosophy Blog](https://xphi.net/), which I maintain, or [The Oldenburg Experimental Philosophy Laboratory](https://uol.de/en/philosophy/research/research-areas/experimental-philosophy), which I founded together with Stephan Kornmesser and Mark Siebel.

By the way, my avatar has been drawn by [Liri Runa](https://linktr.ee/liri_runa) in the art style of [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/).

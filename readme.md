## Hi There! üëã

My name‚Äôs Max. I‚Äôm a research associate at the University of Oldenburg‚Äôs Department of Philosophy, working at the intersection of philosophy and empirical social research in an area known as ‚Äúexperimental philosophy‚Äù (or ‚Äúx-phi‚Äù for short). If you want to know more about me or my research, why not take a look at my [website](https://alephmembeth.github.io/)?

By the way, my avatar has been drawn by [Spiceestew](https://spiceestew.carrd.co/) in the art style of [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/).

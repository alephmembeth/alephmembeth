## Hi There! 👋

My name’s Max. I’m a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Oldenburg’s Department of Philosophy, working at the intersection of philosophy and empirical social research in an area known as “experimental philosophy” (or “x-phi” for short). If you want to know more about me or my research, why not take a look at my [website](https://alephmembeth.github.io/)?

Want to know what’s happening in the world of x-phi right now? Visit [The Experimental Philosophy Blog](https://xphi.net/) that I maintain.

By the way, my avatar has been drawn by [Spiceestew](https://spiceestew.carrd.co/) in the art style of [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/).

## Hi There! 👋

<img src="alephmembeth_2.jpg" align="right" height="325"/>

My name’s Max. I’m a research associate at the University of Oldenburg’s Department of Philosophy, working at the intersection of philosophy and empirical social research in an area known as “experimental philosophy” (or “x-phi” for short). If you want to know more about me or my research, why not take a look at my [website](https://alephmembeth.github.io/)?

My avatar has been drawn by [Spiceestew](https://spiceestew.carrd.co/), and the portrait in this `readme.md` by [Aseagull](https://sites.google.com/view/aseagull/); both in the art style of [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/).

- 🔭 I’m currently working—amongst too many other things—on preparing the defense of my [dissertation](https://github.com/alephmembeth/need-dissertation/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GDScript.
- 💬 Ask me about [(Experimental) Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/experimental-philosophy/), [Need-Based Distributive Justice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/needs/), or [Causation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-metaphysics/).
- 📫 You can reach me via <alexander.max.bauer@uol.de>.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Last time I checked, my Myers-Briggs type was *INFJ-T* (not to be taken too seriously; as Robert Hogan once put it: “Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie”,[^1] but then again, fortune cookies can be fun).
- 🕹️ Currently playing: Baldur’s Gate III, Cyberpunk 2077, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Red Dead Redemption, Stardew Valley

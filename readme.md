### Hi there! 👋

<img src="alephmembeth_1.png" align="right" height="275" />

My name’s Max. I’m a doctoral researcher at the University of Oldenburg’s Department of Philosophy, working at the intersection of philosophy and empirical social research, in an area also known as experimental philosophy (or x-phi for short). If you want to know more about me, why not take a look at my [website](https://alephmembeth.github.io/).

My avatar has been drawn by [Spiceestew](https://spiceestew.carrd.co/), the portrait in this `readme.md` by [Aseagull](https://sites.google.com/view/aseagull/); both in the art style of [Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on finishing my [dissertation](https://github.com/alephmembeth/need-dissertation).

- ⚡ Fun fact: Last time I checked, my Myers-Briggs type was INFJ-T (not to be taken too seriously; as Robert Hogan once put it: “Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie”,[^1] but then again, fortune cookies can be fun)
